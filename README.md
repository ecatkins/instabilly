# MoneyMusic
[MoneyMusic](http://moneymusic.co) was created by Edward Atkins and Adam Jeevaratnam over the course of 4 weeks as a final project for a coding bootcamp.  The idea behind the app was to combine a social network and a music recommendation engine.  Anyone with a Spotify account, free or premium, can sign up, sync their Spotify saved songs and playlists, and begin receiving playlists generated by our algorithm.  Users can even tweak aspects of our algorithm in order to generate playlists based on adjustable criteria.  A user has the ability to like or dislike playlists, which further informs the algorithm about the user's taste in music.  Playlists that are saved in the MoneyMusic app will appear in the users Spotify account.  The social network components allow a user to make posts about specific songs as well as see the posts of the users that they follow.  If a user likes a song posted by another user, they can save it in MoneyMusic, and it will be in their Spotify account.  Sign up with a valid email address and check it out!

Technologies used: Python/Django, PostgreSQL, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
